# The option under [DEFAULT] will be applied to all feeds, unless some specific feed configuration overrules it. For example, if the download directory is # "~/Podcasts", all feeds will be downloaded to this directory except for those that have a different Download directory in their section.

[DEFAULT] 

# The following gives the name of the file in which greg will store the information about feeds and the latest downloaded issue. This is the only option that cannot be overriden by specific podcasts -- that is, any "Data directory" field in a section below will not be read

Data directory = ~/.local/share/greg/

# The following gives the name of the file in which greg will store downloaded podcasts

Download directory = ~/Podcasts/

# For the following option, you can choose 
#   "no" (every feed will be downloaded directly to the download directory)
#   "name" (every feed will be downloaded directly to a directory with the name that you use to refer to the feed in greg, e.g., "Science")
#   "title" (every feed will be downloaded directly to a directory names after the title of the feed, e.g., "Science Magazine Podcast")

Create subdirectories = no

# Answering "yes" to the following option will make greg fill out podcast metadata, using the podcast title as Artist, and the entry title as Title. This is probably most useful as an option to specific podcasts; those that are not correctly tagged at origin.

Tag = no

# In the local version of this file, now you can add sections for indiividual feeds, if and when you need it. The name of the section should be the name you are using to refer to the feed in greg (i.e., one of the names that "greg list" returns):
#
# [MyFeed1]
#
# Download directory = ~/Documents/MyFeed1
#
# Tag = yes
#
# [MyFeed2]
#
# etc.
#
# In the global version of this file (that is, /etc/greg.conf) sections for individual feeds will not be read.
